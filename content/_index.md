Hey!

I'm Pablo.

I work as an Analyst at the [EBRD's Office of the Chief Economist](https://www.ebrd.com/sites/Satellite?c=Content&cid=1395317980748&pagename=EBRD%2FContent%2FContentLayout). Previously, I was a pre-doctoral research assistant working with [Miguel Almunia](https://malmunia.github.io/) and [Claudia Hupkau](https://sites.google.com/view/claudiahupkau/home) at [CUNEF](https://www.cunef.edu/en/), and an intern at the [Bank of Spain](https://www.bde.es/wbe/en/sobre-banco/organizacion/estructura/dg-economia/). I studied economics at the [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) and [UC3M](https://www.uc3m.es/home).

My work leverages large-scale datasets to answer policy-oriented research questions in the realm of applied microeconomics. I also design [interactive visualizations tools](/projects) to maximize the impact of key research products and, in my free time, to tell data stories about whatever I deem interesting.

Fancy a (virtual) coffee?
