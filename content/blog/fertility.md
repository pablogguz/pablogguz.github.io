Since 1950, the number of live births per woman in Spain has decreased from 2.5 to 1.2 &ndash; a reduction of more than 100% in just 70 years. This is the reflection of a broader trend observed in most countries globally, whereby fertility rates have been declining steadily since the mid-20th century.

The latter refers to the influence of social norms and cultural values on fertility decisions, such as the role of women in society, changing family structures, and evolving attitudes towards parenthood.

On the social norms front, the past several decades have seen dramatic shifts in attitudes towards family size, gender roles, and personal fulfillment. Women's increased participation in higher education and the workforce has led to changing expectations and priorities. Many individuals and couples are choosing to delay parenthood or have fewer children to focus on career development, personal goals, or to maintain a certain lifestyle. Additionally, the growing acceptance of childlessness as a valid life choice has contributed to lower birth rates.
