Even if we are non-utilitarians, it is not unreasonable to 


Everyone has their own idea on what an optimal society should look like. However, the underlying objective function is often the same: society reaches an optimum when individual well-being is maximized.[^1] 

I will not write about *how* to do this (at least, not yet). I am also not so interested on justifying *why* we should do it in the first place. I am, though, interested in showing what we should *not* do if we were to prioritize well-being from a policy perspective.

This is the first post of a series about well-being measurement and policy. 

## Definitions 

There is no universal definition of well-being. In the context of policy research, I like to define well-being as the individual's *inner subjective state of satisfaction with their own life*. Nothing less, nothing more.

People often indistinguishably use the idea of *happiness* to refer to well-being. I am not a fan of this from a philosophical standpoint, but it is nonetheless empirically consistent. We will see why. 

The best way we have to elicit individual well-being is via large-scale household surveys. Well-being measures can then be splitted into three categories:
-	**Evaluative** measures stem from asking the respondent how satisfied or happy they are with their life. A common framing is *All thing considered, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?*, with the answer options being either a continuous scale from 0-10 or a Likert-type scale
-	**Hedonic** approaches focus on measuring how people feel at a particular point in time. 



## It is (not) all about the money

Traditionally, the main proxy for well-being in academic and policy circles has been GDP per capita. Which – if I may play devil's advocate – **makes a lot of sense**. Income per capita is positively correlated with metrics that are unambigous drivers of better lives, such as life expectancy, educational attainment, freedom and political liberties...

...and **well-being itself**. Across countries, higher GDP per capita is associated with greater levels of life satisfaction. This finding is remarkably consistent across surveys, and it holds up irrespective of the definition of well-being we use.

What is, then, the catch?

### The Easterlin Paradox




[^1]: Some might argue that we should maximize *societal* well-being. The difference is non-trivial. I tend to dislike the idea of maximizing joint outcomes, especially in cases where they are inherently subjective and cannot be easily aggregated.
