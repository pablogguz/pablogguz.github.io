I´m a big fan of writing for learning and, by extension, for getting to know myself better. Organizing my thoughts and ideas through writing is not only a way to clarify my thinking and to make sense of the world around me, but also a way to reflect on who I am and who I want to be.

I have curated a non-exhaustive list of what I consider to be some of my main traits, values, and beliefs. This list is an ever-growing work in progress and will be updated as I learn and discover more about myself.

## The Life of Pablo

- I am a _very_ curious person who is always eager to learn new things. Even when the expected return is at best questionable, I often find myself going down rabbit holes and spend unreasonable amounts of time researching topics that interest me. 
- I am a perfectionist. I tend to be very hard on myself and set high standards for my work, which paradoxically often leads to suboptimal outcomes ([_If you never miss the plane, you're spending too much time in airports_](https://www.wired.com/story/jordan-ellenburg/)). I am learning to be more forgiving and to embrace the idea that sometimes done is better than perfect, especially when there are clear opportunity costs.
<!-- - I am 60% introvert and 40% extrovert. I genuinely enjoy spending time with people, but I also need time alone to recharge my batteries and to reflect on my thoughts and ideas. I tend to be very selective about the people I spend time with and I value deep, meaningful relationships over superficial ones. -->
- In general, I am a relatively slow thinker. I usually need time to digest information and to come up with ideas and solutions – not the kind of person who can easily think on their feet and give brilliant answers on the spot. 
- I work out often and have been doing sports my whole life. I do not have competitive ambitions anymore, but I do try to maintain a reasonably strong and capable body both for health and aesthetic reasons. Plato wrote: "_In order for man to succeed in life, God provided him with two means, education and physical activity. Not separately, one for the soul and the other for the body, but for the two together. With these two means, a person can attain perfection_".[^1]
- I do not have a specific purpose or calling in life beyond doing things that I find interesting and meaningful. I try to be impactful and do stuff that otherwise would not be done by anyone else, (which usually involves creating value for others), but my primary motivation does not necessarily revolve around altruism. 
- I am not a dogmatic person and tend not to have strong priors about anything. I try to be rational and evidence-based in my thinking, but I am open to changing my mind if someone convinces me that I am wrong. I am _very_ skeptical of people who are overly confident in their beliefs and who are not willing to engage in honest debate.
- I really enjoy traveling as a form of leisure, but [I do not resonate with the idea of traveling as a quasi-spiritual path to self-discovery and personal growth](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/the-case-against-travel). I think that true self-discovery and personal growth come from within and that you can find yourself anywhere, as long as you are willing to look deep enough. From personal experience, problems tend to follow you wherever you go unless you address them.
<!-- - I am a big fan of the idea of [antifragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility). Taleb says that the best way to prepare for an uncertain future is to build systems and habits that are robust to stressors and that can benefit from them.  -->
<!-- - I am not formally religious, but I do consider myself to be a spiritual person. I broadly support Catholic values and beliefs. -->
