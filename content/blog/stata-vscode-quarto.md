Over the last few decades, empirical research in economics has witnessed what is widely termed as [the credibility revolution](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.2.3), a paradigm shift that emphasized the importance of experimental and quasi-experimental methods to credibly identify causal relationships. This transformative period has not only influenced the methodologies employed in academic papers but also strengthened the field's impact on policy-making, by providing more solid and rigorous evidence upon which to base decisions.

The emphasis on methodologically robust empirical research has naturally elevated the importance of data and coding skills within the field. However, despite the increasing importance of coding in economics, many economists lag in adopting modern coding practices and development environments. In fact, one of the most widely used tools in the profession, [Stata](https://www.stata.com/), is not even a programming language[^1], but a purpose-built statistical package. Stata is a commercial software, meaning that it does not have the benefits of open-source languages like Python or R, which have amassed extensive communities contributing to their development and offering support. Due to its nature, it has traditionally been hard to integrate Stata with modern IDEs, which results in a less efficient workflow when one has to write code in multiple languages or wants to use the latest tools for version control, code completion, and so on.

This post is a tutorial on setting up a modern development environment for Stata with Visual Studio Code and Quarto. I do not want to oversell it as it comes with its own caveats, but it is a step in the right direction for those who want to modernize a bit their workflow without having to give up on Stata.

# Why Stata

I know what you are thinking. 

**jUsT dOn't usE sTAta BrO**.


I get it. I code in multiple languages in my work and it is indeed not a good idea to *just* use Stata, simply because there are lots of cool things (web scraping, geospatial stuff, ML) that otherwise you won't be able to do.

However, the truth is that if you do applied microeconomics for a living, in many cases **it would be very stupid not to use Stata**. Whoever tells you otherwise is i) not an applied microeconomist (good for them!) or ii) underestimating how important Stata is in the profession:

- Stata can be found in [more than 70% of replication packages](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/12/usage-shares-of-programming-languages-in-economics-research/) for published papers in economics. It is followed by Matlab (which we deliberately ignore since it is aimed for structural work), and R comes in third with less than 10%. I am not going to argue whether this is a good or a bad equilibrium but _it is an equilibrium_, and if you want to understand what others have done and collaborate you need to learn Stata

- For reduced-form econometrics, Stata is unparallaled. Period. I have been writing code for +3.5 years and it still amazes me how ridiculously cumbersome R and Python are relative to Stata when it comes to running regressions. For some specifications, it is simply not possible to use something else unless you want to code the estimator from scratch (good luck running modern difference-in-differences estimators for heterogeneous treatment effects in Python, for example)

- Economists love regression tables. And again, the functionalities and flexibility of ```esttab``` to export fully formatted and reproducible LaTeX tables in Stata are light years ahead of the alternatives in other languages (e.g., ```stargazer``` in R). 

- If you do applied micro research or policy work, **coding will never truly be your comparative advantage**. An economist is not a commercial data scientist, and it does not make sense to pretend to be one.[^2] Instead, your value lies on the quality of your ideas and how good you execute them â€“ programming is only useful insofar as it helps you in that purpose. Some folks (myself included) enjoy venturing off the beaten path, but most researchers would prioritize research productivity over learning new data skills. In this sense, Stata has a quite shallow and gentle learning curve, so a lot of people learn it as their first "language" and then just stick to it. I am not saying this is good (I think is bad!), but in the end people respond to incentives.

# Why VSCode

VSCode is Microsoft's open-source code editor. It supports a wide array of programming languages and comes with the usual IDE features like syntax highlighting, code completion, Copilot, and version control integration.

More importantly, turns out that it is fairly straightforward to integrate VSCode with Stata via plug-ins. VSCode also has nice LaTeX extensions, which in my opinion makes it the only real alternative to Overleaf. This means that you can seamlessly integrate all your workflow into a single code editor, from data cleaning to drafting.

# Why Quarto

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that allows users to create dynamic documents, slide decks, and reports in various formats from plain text files. Quarto files support multiple programming languages and can be rendered into interactive HTML documents, which allows the user to combine code execution with high-quality document production.

The main advantage of using a notebook-based interface relative to the native Stata editor is that it allows you to create and present exploratory analysis combining code, output, and text (including comments, LaTeX equations, and more), all in one convenient place.

And last but not least, Quarto outputs are [beautiful](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/#interactive-docs).

# Setup

## Step 1: Install Quarto

Go to [https://quarto.org/](https://quarto.org/), click on "Get Started", download the latest Quarto version available, and install it on your machine. 

![Alt text](/img/quarto_example.jpg)

## Step 2: Install VSCode 

Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), download the latest VSCode version available, and install it on your machine.

![Alt text](/img/vscode_example.jpg)

## Step 3: Install VSCode extensions

You will have to install two VSCode extensions:
1. To get nice Stata syntax highlighting and code autocompletion, you will have to install the [Stata Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kylebarron.stata-enhanced) package. Open VSCode, go to the extensions tab (highlighted in red in the screenshot), search for the extension, and install.
2. For integrated render and preview for Quarto documents, repeat the steps above and install the [Quarto](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto) extension.

![Alt text](/img/stataenhanced_example.jpg)

## Step 4: Install ```nbstata```

```nbstata``` is a Jupyter kernel for Stata, built on top of the functionalities of the ```pystata``` Python package introduced in Stata version 17. Unfortunately, this means that you will need Stata 17 or higher to use ```nbstata```.[^3] You can find the full user and installation guide here: [https://hugetim.github.io/nbstata/user_guide.html](https://hugetim.github.io/nbstata/user_guide.html).

The short version goes as follows (for those who are interested, it might be useful to read the full guide to custom your installation to your needs and preferences):

1. In order to install ```nbstata```, you need an installation of Python 3.7 or higher. For first-time Python users, I would follow the suggestion from the author of ```nbstata``` and just install the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). If you want a lighter, minimalistic version, you can go for [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/).[^4]
2. Once you have installed Anaconda, open the Anaconda prompt and type

```
pip install nbstata
```

3. Finally, install ```nbstata``` by running 

```
python -m nbstata.install
```

And that is it! Your machine should be now ready to run Quarto Markdown (```.qmd```) files in VSCode using the ```nbstata``` kernel.

## An example 

To begin, create a ```.qmd``` file. At the very start of this file, incorporate a YAML header to specify the Jupyter kernel you wish to use. In our case, to use ```nbstata``` in your Quarto document, add ```jupyter: nbstata``` within the YAML header. The YAML header is a section located at the top of Markdown files, designed to hold metadata such as configuration settings and document properties. This metadata is structured in a readable format and is essential for defining various aspects of your document's processing and presentation. A sample of YAML header could look as follows:

```m
---
title: "Some dataviz with Stata and Quarto"
date: 2024-24-01
author: "Pablo"
jupyter: nbstata
format: 
  html:
    self-contained: true
    toc: true
    toc-depth: 3
    toc-float:
      collapsed: false
      smooth-scroll: true
      width: 20%
---
```

You can now create code chunks as you would do in any other notebook-based interface, specifying ```stata``` in your code chunk. 

For our example, we will create a simple chart to visualize gender gaps in suicide rates across countries. To load the dataset into our environment, we will use the Stata wrapper for the World Bank's WDI database API, [```wbopendata```](https://github.com/jpazvd/wbopendata/tree/master):


````stata
```{stata load-data}
wbopendata, indicator(SH.STA.SUIC.FE.P5; SH.STA.SUIC.MA.P5) clear long

```

  labmask order, val(countryname)

  su male_rate, d
  local x_max = round(r(max),0.1) // max value for y-axis

```

# Caveats

Sadly, the integration of Stata with VSCode and Quarto is far from perfect, specially if you are used to the native Stata editor and its functionalities. Here are some of the issues that bother me:

- You will be missing the data browser and the variable explorer. This is a big one. The Stata data browser is also incredibly smooth and fast compared to the alternatives in R and Python, so it is a shame to lose one of its comparative advantages
- You will not be able to change the font for your charts within VSCode. Not a big deal, you can always change it by opening Stata itself and changing the defaults with the ```graph set``` commands, but it is a bit annoying


# Troubleshooting

In case you are finding issues with your setup, you should verify your installations and ensure that the Jupyter kernel is correctly set up and recognnized by your system.

To check if Quarto is installed and determine its version, open your command prompt (or terminal on macOS and Linux) and enter the following command:

```
quarto check
```
If Quarto is not found, ensure it is installed and that its installation directory is added to your system's PATH environment variable. Reinstalling may also help.

To verify that Python is installed on your system and to check its version, run:

```
python --version
```

To check your Python installation directory, run 

```
where python
```

This command should return the version of Python installed on your system. If Python is not installed or if there are issues with the installation, this command may return an error or indicate that Python is not recognized. Similar to Quarto, ensure Python's installation directory is in your PATH. If you have multiple Python versions installed, ensure the correct version's path is prioritized.

To check which Jupyter kernels are installed on your system, use:

```
jupyter kernelspec list
```

This command will list all available kernels, including their names and installation paths. If you've installed a kernel (such as ```nbstata```) but it doesn't appear in this list, there may be an issue with how the kernel was installed or registered with Jupyter. 

## Common issue: Quarto does not recognize the Python installation

To ensure your system uses the Anaconda installation when you run Python commands (and by extension, to help Quarto find the correct Python), you can try the following steps:
1. Disable app execution aliases for Python: Open Settings, go to Windows Settings > Apps > Apps & features, and manage execution aliases to disable Python aliases (i.e., turn off the toggle(s) that point to the Microsoft Store app, ```python.exe``` and ```python3.exe```). By disabling these, you prevent Windows from redirecting Python commands to the Microsoft Store app, allowing your system to use the Anaconda Python executable instead.
2. Adjusting the PATH order: go to System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables, then select the "Path" variable under User variables or System variables and click "Edit". In the Edit Environment Variable window, find the entry for ```C:\Users\[your-username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps```. You can either remove this entry or move it down the list so that the paths to your Anaconda installation appear above it. This changes the order in which Windows searches these paths for executable files. To check the order of your PATH environment variable, type ```where python``` in the Anaconda prompt (usually, it should be ```C:\ProgramData\anaconda3```). Then, add this path to the PATH environment variable and move it to the top of the list, adding also the ```Scripts``` folder (usually, ```C:\ProgramData\anaconda3\Scripts```).

# Bonus: run ```.do``` files in VSCode

If you are not interested in running code interactively, you can also run your usual Stata ```.do``` files within VSCode. 

To do so, install the [stataRun](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Yeaoh.stataRun) extension in VSCode. Then, press ```Ctrl+,``` to open the settings tab, type "stataRun" in the search tab, and set up your paths and preferences accordingly. For macOS users, this is (apparently) all you need to do; for Windows and Linus it is sadly a bit more involved. You can find the instructions in the link above. I have not tested it, so I cannot say much more.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

[^1]: Stata though has its own matrix-based programming language, _Mata_. Some of the most popular user-written Stata packages, like ```reghdfe``` for regressions with high dimensional fixed effects, are largely written in Mata.

[^2]: Unless you want to work in industry, of course.

[^3]: For earlier Stata versions, an alternative would be using the ```stata_kernel``` for Jupyter notebooks. I have not tested it, but I have good references from colleagues. You can find the installation guide [here](https://kylebarron.dev/stata_kernel/).

[^4]: ```nbstata``` is a Jupyter kernel. If you install Anaconda, you will also get JupyterLab installed, so you will be able to run Stata code from Jupyter notebooks as well. I hate them, but if you don't it is an alternative.
